                            <p> On some day of July 2062 near county side of Azamgarh up kissed a burning meteoroid which rather went unnoticed because of the incessant rain, rumming cloud and thunder. Locals seeing meteoroid far more different than the usual depiction in the magazine and internet reported it to the press, police, zamindar, thekadar and whom not.
                                Before the strike Naina was working on the plastic sheet and the wax coating of our playing hut. Just in the matter of second that thing dug ‘may be 7 feet’ into our land that was toiled last evening for planting paddy crop. It created slope in the slope and water from all the surrounding field rushed into it as if gold were gone free. I slid down into the crater to check what on earth can be so reckless and violent. On reaching down only thing that I remember is of strange vibration and me vomiting very badly and quickly I rushed back towards naina and next thing that people told me regarding that event was I woke up after 18 hours of complete oblivion .When I woke up that place was fenced with red straps calling “POLICE”.
                                Now I realise that I was the first lost human to the immortals of galaxy. A day after I woke up everyone in the region saw the commandoes live taking on 8 lives creatures which were almost like us and the ‘go’ was quite easy as the creature seemed to have given up before the end of the tackle. It was broadcasted later in cuts. It was celebrated deep throughout the country as victory but only I and eight others knew that the war has just began.
                                A day later things started to get weird as I was able to think and satisfy logic more than anyone and ever. It was no too late when I realised that my head was giving more pain and rest of my body was going senseless. I was high to the extent that I  was able to give theory on universe formation and other galaxies and even what has infested me; those were celestial bodies which were complex and intelligent of highest order and in order to make themselves immortals had made them a form of parasite whose host were creature with some material body depending on the compatibility.in case of human male were more of the choice than female. I tried to delve deep but things turned dim slowly.
                                Next day when I got conscious, sat with coffee on the table and explored deep to conclude on the serious facts that I will be me for another may be 8 days more and then my brain will loose all control over my body and then may be after that all the neurons and dendrons that have started growing will gain full access over me.
                                I learned later that evening, the creatures were quite organised and that each of them had especially assigned task. the one in my head or just in me was some sort of command or report junction of them. 
                                Question -why was i infested when female is less compatible as host?
                                The answer that I could investigate was during the landing or perhaps bad landing the host of the immortal was badly injured and almost immobile so for the safety concerns it considered me as option. (after the predators got the human body, they realised that humans were unaware of their presence and that human had no idea of their existence rather anywhere in the space.
                                However the worst part now ,because I can peek into them and my physique is changing so I have become a potential threat, as a result the rest eight of them are coming to kill me and find new host for the parasite(technically it is not a parasite though as it is benefiting from me as host but not through nutrient supply as it is immortal)  inside me, also they are being helped by subconscious me.
                                The next thing which I discovered almost shattered me and why not when you are a mere girl who has never been to market alone ever and you realise that 8 person are coming for you who were earlier black cat commando in Indian Army and if I do not move they may reach to me at the end of 2nd day , that is enough to make you shit go parallelly between your legs without you being informed.
                                On further digging I got to know that the shit inside me cannot leave me anyway like that because that will make it vulnerable to being exposed as mental capacity which has increased will remain unaltered. remaining only solution to kill me and then then adopt some male body. That afternoon I saw me hurting myself however because of partial control I could not save my left leg from one blow that almost left it motion less. The other immortals were approaching fast and if I did not move or escape then I would be dead by next afternoon. And so I went into the creature to look into the it fears ,hours and hours passed on but there was no sign of any incident,event,object or person that instilled fear into these creatures .however things did not go in vain as I was able to get the composition of few mineral rather rare minerals which had the capacity to rather capture the immortals completely making them paralaysed.it was no difficult there after to realise that it is found in the root of some fancy kind of tree in the Himalayan jungle of Nepal thanks to google and my newly attained power of thought and analysis.at that time my legs and physical body had almost lost the physical contact with mind.
                                I stole around 10000 rupees from my parent’s secret trunk box which I do not have any idea what they were to them and left the place as soon as possible to revive my self and no so exaggerating but entire humanity too. Well I should indeed tell you about the hypnotising skill and the one to look into anyone brain more because that thing is getting my nerve and neuron denser and so my brain is able to comprehend and analyse more things at the same time. I took bus to Nepal only after I had a neck and plaster all over my neck, hands and legs. The reason I did plaster was because I had an idea that the creature inside me will try to hurt me possible by making me immotile and helpless physically so that I am not able to reach that place before the other immortal got better hold of me. When I was in the bus, it was then I realised that all my finger was soft and unresponsive as hell. By evening I had reached a cliff from were I was able to locate huge landmass of greenery but because of the sudden convulsion I just slipped from there going through the mosses, herb, bushes and yeah lot of rocks that hit my organ equally. I woke up and found that legs were fractured badly head swollen up but it was near to the morning i.e. 6th day that I found that my head was swollen, big but lighter than usual. Then there something weird that struck my eyes “the roots” of the tree on which I was swooned, was glowing with sparkle in sunshine. It was not very late when I realised that the roots absorbed them and restricted any further movement of the immortal.
                                Now things began to get complex, the remaining of 8 of them knew that they lost their junction and hence they are no more connected and hence they are in danger too. Their frustration must have been high as they hurried through the forest lanes .i had really small sum of time to lay a trap and get more ways to fix them into the roots at the same time I had to find the solution for broken legs, cracked ribs, swollen head and arms.
                                Now only solution that remain to me was may ne self-sacrifice as I was going to again occupy the predator in me so as to call the rest of them and made them jump from the cliff.
                                Off course it was a success but days were hell over for humanly body, which was groaning and starving and probably mind bursting. Yah! they all got captured but on the long run I believe they won as they were there only till no one axed those trees as I too breathed my last in the jungle.</p>
